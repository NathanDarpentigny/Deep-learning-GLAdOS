# Deep-learning-GLAdOS

This is the repository for the GLAdOS group of the DeepLearning project from Supelec2015. The main code and JavaDoc can be found in the main project. The project contains, as of now, two main classes : one for the learning process of a neural network (LearningWindow) and a gui for the testing process of a neural network (TestingWindow). All the neural networks we produced are stored in the DeepLearningTests/src/resultingNN file.

For any information on this project, do not hesitate to contact us at deep-glados@supelec.fr.
